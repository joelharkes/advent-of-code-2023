# Advent of code 2023

These are the code solutions of https://adventofcode.com/2023 in dart code.


## Reasoning

I've been always fasinated by Dart programming langauge (and flutter eco system) but never had the time do familiarize myself with it. I thought this would be a simple way to get familiar with the Dart language.

I like to be pragmatic, find a solution first with an MVP. Afterwards if I see value or enjoyment I clean up the code to be more readable.

! This by no means should be taken as examples for clean code or domain driven development.
